So as you probably already know (or are in the process of finding out), the linux kernel is pretty intense to get started with. I am finding a number of challenges in getting to my first contribution. 
So far I see the following hurdles
- how do I know what needs doing? (issue tracking/browsing)
- How do I make a contribution once I've found something to add/fix?
- How can I develop the kernel locally?
  - Do I need a VM or can I build it straight on my host?
  - Do I need linux or just linux like tools
  - Is there a specific build process I need to be aware of?
  - Are there existing `.pre-commit` ish things I need to be running?
- How much work is reasonable to put in myself before I should reach out to the community?
  - Before I submit a patch
  - Before I beg for aid (and how would I do that?)
