So as you probably already know (or are in the process of finding out), the linux kernel is pretty intense to get started with. I am finding a number of challenges in getting to my first contribution. 
So far I see the following hurdles
- how do I know what needs doing? (issue tracking/browsing)
- How do I make a contribution once I've found something to add/fix?
- How can I develop the kernel locally?
  - Do I need a VM or can I build it straight on my host?
  - Do I need linux or just linux like tools
  - Is there a specific build process I need to be aware of?
  - Are there existing `.pre-commit` ish things I need to be running?
- How much work is reasonable to put in myself before I should reach out to the community?
  - Before I submit a patch
  - Before I beg for aid (and how would I do that?)

## General Atmosphere

> I answered that given my current level of knowledge the best for me would be to work with one of the maintainers who could tell me what shall be done and later review my work so that I could learn and do something useful at the same time. Can you guess the answer? It was:
> 
> “No maintainer has that time, sorry.”
> 
> In this particular moment I understood what my attitude should be. I immediately saw that I need to be proactive because no one will do any kind of work for me. This reminded me of a quote from one of the hacker movies that I enjoyed as a teenager; it fits:
> 
> “This business is all about bits. It is up to us if we are one or zero.”

## Getting Started TODOs

### Target 'code quality' tasks
- [ ] Read the Kernel [Style Guide](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle)
- [ ] Use `checkpatch.pl`
> There is a tool called *checkpatch.pl* which resides in the *scripts* directory of the kernel repository
- [ ] Use [sparse](https://sparse.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page) to fix broken code
> `sudo apt-get install sparse`

- [ ] Read the TODOs
> `% echo "" > /tmp/todolist-kernel.txt; count=0; for entry in `find . -name "*TODO*"`; do echo $count". "$entry`git log --pretty=format:" Last edited %ar" $entry | head -1` >> /tmp/todolist-kernel.txt; echo "" >> /tmp/todolist-kernel.txt; sed 's/^/        /' $entry >> /tmp/todolist-kernel.txt; echo "" >> /tmp/todolist-kernel.txt; ((count=$count+1)); done`
> the information in the TODOs, at least in the staging area, should be accurate.
> The code in staging does not meet the quality standards and the job is to make it good enough to be promoted as a ‘real’ kernel driver. This makes it a perfect place to start from especially when combined with the information from TODOs.

- [ ] Read about the [Linux Driver Project](http://www.linuxdriverproject.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page)
- [ ] Kernel bugs are tracked using [Bugzilla](http://bugzilla.kernel.org/)

## Kernel Contribution Methods

- start in the drivers/staging area
- improve the code quality
- find inspiration in the TODOs
- fix an actual bug in the kernel.
