Every developer eventually succumbs to the urge to start a blog. Today, I join that tradition.

## Why Another Tech Blog?

Mostly for myself, honestly. I've spent years accumulating notes in various markdown files, Notion pages, and random GitHub gists. This blog is an attempt to consolidate that knowledge into something more structured - and maybe useful to others.

I work on distributed systems during the day and break things at night. The intersection of building reliable systems and understanding how they fail is endlessly fascinating to me.

## What to Expect

Topics will likely include:
- **Systems programming** - Low-level C, Rust, and Go
- **Security** - DFIR, reverse engineering, vulnerability research
- **Infrastructure** - Kubernetes, cloud architecture, observability
- **Random experiments** - Hardware hacking, eBPF, whatever catches my attention

No promises on posting frequency. I'd rather write something useful occasionally than churn out content for its own sake.

## The Stack

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and deployed on Cloudflare Workers. The terminal aesthetic is intentional - I spend most of my time in one anyway.

Let's see where this goes.
