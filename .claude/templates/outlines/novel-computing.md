## Meta Requirements

### Novel Computing Alignment Checklist

Novel computing posts explore alternatives to conventional binary digital computation. Your writing should:

- [ ] **First principles reasoning** — Why might this paradigm work? What physics/math enables it?
- [ ] **Honest comparison** — Fair baseline against optimized conventional approaches
- [ ] **Application clarity** — Where this paradigm has advantage, not "general purpose better"
- [ ] **Maturity awareness** — Acknowledge research stage vs. production readiness
- [ ] **Fundamental limits** — What are the theoretical bounds? What are the engineering gaps?
- [ ] **Skeptic-friendly** — Address obvious objections head-on

**Novel Computing Voice Examples:**
- ✅ "Ternary logic reduces transistor count for X operation because..."
- ✅ "In-memory computing eliminates data movement, but introduces precision challenges..."
- ✅ "This approach is promising for Y, but currently limited by Z. Here's the research path..."
- ❌ "This will replace conventional computing" (overclaiming)
- ❌ "Obviously [paradigm] is better" (without rigorous comparison)
- ❌ "If we just had better [component], this would work" (hand-waving barriers)

---

### Novel Computing Context

Novel computing paradigms include:
- **Non-binary logic**: Ternary, multi-valued logic, fuzzy logic
- **Analog computing**: Continuous-valued computation
- **In-memory computing**: Processing where data lives
- **Optical computing**: Computation with photons
- **Quantum computing**: Superposition and entanglement
- **Reversible computing**: Thermodynamically efficient computation
- **Stochastic computing**: Probabilistic bit streams
- **Hyperdimensional computing**: High-dimensional vector operations

Your post should clearly position within this landscape.

## Post Structure

Follow the **Motivation → Principles → Implementation → Reality Check → Future** flow.

### Title

Use intriguing but precise titles:
- "Beyond Binary: [Paradigm] for [Application]"
- "[Paradigm] Computing: Promise, Reality, and Path Forward"
- "What If [Different Assumption]? Exploring [Paradigm]"
- "[Application] with [Paradigm]: [Result/Learning]"

---

### Hook (100-150 words)

- Start with a provocative but defensible claim
- Challenge an assumption most readers hold
- Preview what you'll explore

**Example hooks:**
- "We've had ternary computers since 1958. Why aren't we using them?"
- "Light travels at c. Why don't we compute with it?"
- "What if 'errors' were features, not bugs?"

---

### 1. The Case for Alternatives (400-500 words)

#### 1.1 Limits of Conventional Computing
- What are we hitting with current approaches?
- Dennard scaling end, memory wall, power wall
- Where does conventional computing waste?

#### 1.2 The Alternative Premise
- What assumption does this paradigm change?
- What does that unlock theoretically?
- Why hasn't this been explored (or why is it being revisited)?

#### 1.3 Why Now?
- What's changed that makes this tractable?
- New materials, new algorithms, new applications
- Renewed interest drivers

| Aspect | Conventional | [Your Paradigm] | Implications |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Information unit | Binary bit | [e.g., Trit, analog value] | [What changes] |
| Computation model | Boolean logic | [Alternative] | [What changes] |

### 2. Foundational Principles (500-700 words)

#### 2.1 The Physics/Mathematics

**[FIGURE: Fundamental Principle Illustration]**

- What physical or mathematical property enables this?
- Key equations or relationships
- Theoretical advantages

For example (ternary):
```
Binary:  log₂(N) bits to represent N states
Ternary: log₃(N) trits to represent N states
         log₃(N) = log₂(N) / log₂(3) ≈ 0.63 × log₂(N)

→ ~37% fewer digits for same information
→ But each digit requires 3-state device
```

#### 2.2 Computational Model

- How is computation expressed?
- What are the primitive operations?
- How do they compose?

**[FIGURE: Primitive Operations]**

```
Example: Ternary Logic Operations
| A | B | MIN | MAX | Consensus |
|---|---|-----|-----|-----------|
| - | - |  -  |  -  |     -     |
| - | 0 |  -  |  0  |     -     |
| - | + |  -  |  +  |     0     |
| 0 | 0 |  0  |  0  |     0     |
| 0 | + |  0  |  +  |     0     |
| + | + |  +  |  +  |     +     |
```
