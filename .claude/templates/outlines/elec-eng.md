## Meta Requirements

### Electrical Engineering Alignment Checklist

EE posts bridge theory and practical implementation. Your writing should:

- [ ] **Theory grounded** — Connect to fundamental principles (Ohm's law, KVL/KCL, signal theory)
- [ ] **Practical focus** — Real components, real constraints, real measurements
- [ ] **Safety conscious** — Highlight hazards, required precautions
- [ ] **Reproducible builds** — Bill of materials, schematics, PCB files if applicable
- [ ] **Test methodology** — How you verified the design works
- [ ] **Failure analysis** — What went wrong and why

**EE Voice Examples:**
- ✅ "The datasheet specifies X, but in practice I measured Y because..."
- ✅ "I chose this component because of its [parameter] characteristics..."
- ✅ "The simulation showed X, bench testing revealed Y..."
- ❌ "It just works" (without explaining why)
- ❌ "Trust the datasheet" (without validation)
- ❌ "I used this part because I had it lying around" (without analysis)

## Writing Notes

### EE Post Guidelines

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Show calculations | Just state values |
| Include part numbers | Generic descriptions |
| Explain component choices | "I used what I had" |
| Compare sim to measured | Only show simulation |
| Document failures | Hide mistakes |
| Provide complete BOM | Incomplete parts list |

### Safety First

- Lead with hazards in relevant projects
- Include proper warnings
- Recommend appropriate PPE
- Consider reader skill level

### Reproducibility

- Complete enough for someone to replicate
- Note any custom parts or modifications
- Provide source files, not just PDFs
- Include purchasing links where helpful

### Theory Balance

- Enough theory to understand design choices
- Not a textbook—reference external resources for deep dives
- Connect theory to practical decisions
