## Meta Requirements

### VLSI Engineering Alignment Checklist

VLSI posts bridge architecture, circuit design, and physical implementation. Your writing should:

- [ ] **Multi-abstraction thinking** — Connect system-level to transistor-level decisions
- [ ] **PPA awareness** — Power, Performance, Area tradeoffs explicit throughout
- [ ] **Process-aware design** — Acknowledge technology node implications
- [ ] **Simulation rigor** — Clear methodology, corner coverage, Monte Carlo where appropriate
- [ ] **Physical design consideration** — Layout, routing, timing closure awareness
- [ ] **Reproducibility** — HDL snippets, tool flows, constraints shareable

**VLSI Voice Examples:**
- ✅ "At the 7nm node, leakage dominates, so we chose..."
- ✅ "Post-layout simulation showed 15% timing degradation due to routing congestion in..."
- ✅ "The architecture trades 20% area for 2x throughput by..."
- ❌ "The circuit works" (without PPA characterization)
- ❌ "Synthesis results show..." (without specifying constraints, corner)
- ❌ "Obviously this is better" (without quantitative comparison)

## Writing Notes

### VLSI Post Guidelines

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Specify technology node | Use vague "advanced node" |
| Report all PPA metrics | Cherry-pick favorable metrics |
| State simulation conditions | Assume reader knows corners |
| Compare fairly | Compare different nodes without normalization |
| Show area/power breakdown | Report only totals |
| Acknowledge limitations | Claim superiority without caveats |

### Abstraction Navigation

- Start at system level for context
- Dive to relevant detail level
- Surface back to implications
- Don't lose reader in either direction

### Tool Transparency

- Name synthesis/P&R tools and versions
- Specify constraint assumptions
- Note any tool-specific optimizations
