**Target Length:** [1000-2000] words
**Type:** Development Blog / Project Update
**Tone:** "Here's what we shipped and what we learned"

---

## Meta Requirements

### Dev Blog Alignment Checklist

Development blogs share project progress, decisions, and learnings. Your writing should:

- [ ] **Show, don't just tell** — Include code, screenshots, demos
- [ ] **Context for newcomers** — Don't assume readers followed your last post
- [ ] **Decision rationale** — Explain why, not just what
- [ ] **Honest about tradeoffs** — What you sacrificed for what you gained
- [ ] **Lessons transferable** — Readers should learn something applicable to their work
- [ ] **Progress over perfection** — Share work-in-progress, not just polished results

**Dev Blog Voice Examples:**
- ✅ "We shipped X this week. Here's why we made these choices..."
- ✅ "This didn't work the way we expected. Here's what we learned..."
- ✅ "If you're building something similar, watch out for..."
- ❌ "Everything went perfectly according to plan."
- ❌ "We're excited to announce..." (marketing speak)
- ❌ "Stay tuned for more updates!" (without substance)

### Visual Requirements

| Visual Type | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| Screenshots | Show UI/output | When describing user-facing changes |
| Code diffs | Show what changed | When explaining refactors or fixes |
| Architecture diagrams | Show structure | When introducing new components |
| GIFs/demos | Show interactions | For features best understood in motion |
| Metrics charts | Show impact | When quantifying improvements |

## Post Structure

Follow the **Context → What We Built → How We Built It → What We Learned** flow.

## Writing Notes

### Dev Blog Guidelines

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Share work-in-progress | Wait for perfection |
| Include actual code | Describe code abstractly |
| Admit mistakes | Pretend everything went smoothly |
| Explain decisions | Just show end results |
| Link to previous context | Assume readers remember |
| Show metrics when available | Make vague claims |

### Tone Calibration

- More casual than research posts
- First person ("I" or "we") is fine
- Technical but accessible
- Enthusiastic without being promotional

### Frequency Considerations

- Regular cadence builds audience
- Shorter, more frequent > longer, sporadic
- Summarize previous posts briefly for new readers
