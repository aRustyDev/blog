## Meta Requirements

### Research Engineer Alignment Checklist

Research Engineers blend research rigor with engineering delivery. Your writing should demonstrate:

- [ ] **Hypothesis-driven framing** — Start with a clear hypothesis or research question, not just "I built X"
- [ ] **Methodology transparency** — Describe how you did the work in enough detail for replication
- [ ] **Empirical grounding** — Support claims with data, experiments, or systematic observation
- [ ] **Intellectual honesty** — Acknowledge what you don't know, what didn't work, and where you're uncertain
- [ ] **Limitation awareness** — Explicitly state scope boundaries and what conclusions you cannot draw
- [ ] **Open questions** — Demonstrate you see beyond your current work to unsolved problems
- [ ] **Engineering pragmatism** — Ground abstractions in concrete implementations and real-world applicability

**Research Engineer Voice Examples:**
- ✅ "We hypothesized that graph-based memory would outperform vector retrieval. Our experiments on N conversations showed..."
- ✅ "This approach has significant limitations: we tested only on English text and cannot conclude..."
- ✅ "An open question remains: how does this scale beyond our test corpus?"
- ❌ "I built a cool thing and it works great!"
- ❌ "This is the definitive solution to X."
- ❌ "Trust me, it's better."

## Post Structure

Follow the **Problem → Approach → Experiment → Results → Limitations** flow.

---

### Abstract (150-200 words)

Write LAST, after the post is complete. Include:
- **Problem statement** — What gap or challenge does this address?
- **Approach summary** — What did you do? (1-2 sentences)
- **Key finding** — What's the headline result?
- **Scope acknowledgment** — What are the main limitations?

```
[TEMPLATE]
[Problem]: [One sentence stating the gap/challenge]
[Approach]: [One sentence on methodology]
[Finding]: [One sentence on key result]
[Scope]: [One sentence on main limitations]
```

---

### 1. Introduction (400-500 words)

#### 1.1 Problem Statement
- What specific problem are you addressing?
- Why does this problem matter?
- Who is affected by this problem?

**Framing guidance:** Lead with the problem, not your solution. The reader should understand why this matters before learning what you did.

#### 1.2 Hypothesis or Research Question
- State your hypothesis explicitly
- Or frame as a research question if exploratory

```
**Hypothesis:** [X will outperform Y because Z]
— OR —
**Research Question:** [How does X affect Y under conditions Z?]
```

#### 1.3 Contribution Summary
- What does this post contribute?
- Is it: new data, new methodology, new framework, new tool?
- What will the reader learn?

#### 1.4 Scope Statement
- What is IN scope?
- What is explicitly OUT of scope?
- What audience is this written for?

**[UNCERTAINTY CALLOUT]**
> ⚠️ **Uncertainty:** [State any major uncertainties about your framing, assumptions, or approach here. E.g., "This is early-stage research. We present preliminary findings, not validated conclusions."]

---

### 2. Background (400-600 words)

#### 2.1 Domain Context
- What does the reader need to know to understand your work?
- Define key terms
- Explain relevant concepts

#### 2.2 Prior Work
- What has been done before?
- What approaches exist?
- Where are the gaps?

**Citation target:** This section should be citation-heavy. Every claim about prior work needs a reference.

#### 2.3 Your Position in the Landscape
- How does your work relate to prior work?
- Are you extending, critiquing, or replacing?
- What's your unique angle?

---

### 3. Methodology / Approach (500-700 words)

**[UNCERTAINTY CALLOUT]**
> ⚠️ **Uncertainty:** [Acknowledge methodological choices that might be questioned. E.g., "Our choice of X over Y may affect results. We did not test alternative configurations."]

---

### 4. Results (400-600 words)

#### 4.1 Primary Results
- Present main findings
- Use data, not just claims
- Compare to baseline/alternatives

**[VISUAL TARGET: Results Table/Chart]**

**Important:** Negative results are valuable. Report them honestly.

**[UNCERTAINTY CALLOUT]**
> ⚠️ **Uncertainty:** [Report confidence intervals, variance, or statistical significance limitations. E.g., "With N=50, our confidence interval is wide. These results should be considered preliminary."]

---

### 5. Discussion (300-400 words)

### 6. Limitations

**⚠️ EXPLICIT LIMITATIONS SECTION — REQUIRED**

This section is mandatory. Skipping or minimizing limitations signals low research maturity.

- Data quality concerns
- Representativeness questions

#### 6.4 What We Cannot Conclude
- Explicitly state conclusions you CANNOT draw
- What would be needed to draw those conclusions?

**Template sentences:**
- "We tested only [X], so cannot conclude about [Y]."
- "Our sample of N=[X] limits statistical power for [Y]."
- "We did not evaluate [X], which may affect [Y]."
- "These results should not be interpreted as [X]."

---

### 7. Open Questions

#### Questions for Future Work
- [ ] [Open question 1]
- [ ] [Open question 2]
- [ ] [Open question 3]
- [ ] [Open question 4]
- [ ] [Open question 5]

**Template:**
- "How does [X] scale to [larger context]?"
- "What is the relationship between [X] and [Y]?"
- "Can [approach] be adapted for [different domain]?"
- "What explains the [unexpected observation]?"
- "How do we measure [concept that lacks clear metrics]?"

---

### 8. Conclusion (150-200 words)

- Restate problem and contribution (1-2 sentences)
- Summarize key findings (1-2 sentences)
- Acknowledge limitations (1 sentence)
- Point to future directions (1-2 sentences)

**Avoid:**

---

### References

Use Zotero export. Format consistently (IEEE or ACM style).

```
[1] Author, A. et al. (Year). "Title." Venue/Journal. DOI/URL.
[2] ...
```

---

### Appendix (Optional)

Include supplementary material that supports but doesn't fit in main text:
- Extended methodology details
- Full data tables
- Additional code examples
- Raw results

---

## Writing Notes

### Tone Guidelines
| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "We observed X" | "X is true" |
| "Our results suggest Y" | "This proves Y" |
| "Under our test conditions" | "Always" / "Never" |
| "One limitation is Z" | [Omitting limitations] |
| "An open question is W" | "This solves everything" |

### Structure Guidelines
- **Lead with findings in each section.** Don't bury the lead.
- **Use topic sentences.** First sentence of each paragraph should convey the main point.
- **Break up walls of text.** Use bullets, tables, code blocks, and visuals.
- **Be specific.** "37% improvement" not "significant improvement."

### Research Engineer Voice
You're demonstrating that you:
1. Can formulate testable hypotheses
2. Design rigorous evaluations
3. Report results honestly (including failures)
4. Acknowledge limitations without excessive hedging
5. See beyond current work to open problems

- [ ] Code blocks are tested and syntactically correct
- [ ] Limitations section is substantive (not perfunctory)
