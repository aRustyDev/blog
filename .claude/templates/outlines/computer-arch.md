## Meta Requirements

### Computer Architecture Alignment Checklist

Architecture posts connect workload requirements to hardware organization. Your writing should:

- [ ] **Workload-driven design** — Every architectural choice motivated by workload characteristics
- [ ] **Quantitative reasoning** — Roofline analysis, bottleneck identification, Amdahl's law
- [ ] **Multi-level thinking** — ISA, microarchitecture, memory hierarchy, system integration
- [ ] **PPA tradeoff clarity** — Explicit about what you're trading for what
- [ ] **Scalability analysis** — How design choices affect scaling
- [ ] **Comparison rigor** — Fair baselines, normalized metrics, sensitivity analysis

**Architecture Voice Examples:**
- ✅ "Roofline analysis shows this workload is memory-bound at X ops/byte..."
- ✅ "We trade 2× area for 4× throughput by duplicating the [unit], justified by..."
- ✅ "The dataflow architecture eliminates 80% of register file accesses because..."
- ❌ "Our architecture is faster" (without workload context)
- ❌ "We added more compute units" (without bottleneck analysis)
- ❌ "Novel architecture for AI" (without specificity)

## Writing Notes

### Architecture Post Guidelines

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Start with workload analysis | Start with architecture description |
| Quantify bottlenecks | Make vague claims |
| Show roofline/bounds | Ignore theoretical limits |
| Compare fairly (normalize PPA) | Cherry-pick metrics |
| Explain what you trade away | Claim all-around better |
| Sensitivity analysis | Single-point comparisons |

### Quantitative Rigor

- Every claim should have a number
- Show your analysis methodology
- Include confidence/error bounds
- Sensitivity analysis is essential

### Balancing Depth and Breadth

- Full architecture for overview
- Deep dive on key innovations
- Reference appendix for completeness
- Don't get lost in details
