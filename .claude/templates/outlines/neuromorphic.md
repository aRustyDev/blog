## Meta Requirements

### Neuromorphic Alignment Checklist

Neuromorphic posts bridge neuroscience inspiration with computational implementation. Your writing should:

- [ ] **Biological grounding** — Clear about what neuroscience inspires vs. what's engineering abstraction
- [ ] **Computational model clarity** — Neuron model, learning rule, network topology explicit
- [ ] **Event-driven thinking** — Exploit temporal sparsity, asynchronous computation
- [ ] **Energy-aware design** — Power/energy metrics central, not afterthought
- [ ] **Learning mechanism specification** — How the system adapts (if applicable)
- [ ] **Comparison honesty** — Fair comparison to conventional approaches with appropriate metrics

**Neuromorphic Voice Examples:**
- ✅ "The LIF neuron model captures spike timing with 3 state variables, trading biological fidelity for..."
- ✅ "At 5% average spike rate, energy scales as O(spikes) not O(timesteps), yielding..."
- ✅ "STDP-inspired learning achieves 92% accuracy with 100× less training energy because..."
- ❌ "This is how the brain works" (overclaiming biological validity)
- ❌ "Obviously neuromorphic is more efficient" (without workload-specific analysis)
- ❌ "We use spiking neurons" (without specifying model, encoding, learning)

## Writing Notes

### Neuromorphic Post Guidelines

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Specify neuron model precisely | Vaguely say "spiking" |
| Report energy, not just power | Ignore temporal factors |
| Compare to appropriate baselines | Only compare to other neuromorphic |
| Acknowledge biological simplifications | Overclaim brain similarity |
| Show activity/sparsity metrics | Ignore spike statistics |
| Explain encoding scheme | Assume reader knows |

### Energy Measurement

- Specify what's included
- Report per-inference AND throughput
- Compare at same accuracy where possible
- Include system overhead if claiming system efficiency

### Biological Claims

- Be precise about what's bio-inspired vs. bio-realistic
- Cite neuroscience sources for inspiration
- Acknowledge simplifications explicitly
- Avoid "like the brain" without qualification
