## Meta Requirements

### Photonics Alignment Checklist

Photonics posts bridge optics fundamentals with practical device/system design. Your writing should:

- [ ] **Physics grounding** — Connect to Maxwell's equations, waveguide theory, nonlinear optics
- [ ] **Fabrication awareness** — Process constraints, tolerances, yield considerations
- [ ] **System context** — Where this device fits in larger photonic/opto-electronic systems
- [ ] **Characterization rigor** — Measurement methodology, uncertainty quantification
- [ ] **Loss budgeting** — Insertion loss, coupling loss, propagation loss accounting
- [ ] **Wavelength/bandwidth specification** — Operating range, dispersion, spectral characteristics

**Photonics Voice Examples:**
- ✅ "The MZI achieves 30dB extinction ratio with 0.5dB insertion loss at 1550nm..."
- ✅ "Fabrication tolerance analysis shows the device maintains <1dB excess loss for ±10nm width variation..."
- ✅ "We couple to fiber with 2dB loss using an inverse taper, limited by mode mismatch..."
- ❌ "The device works" (without optical characterization)
- ❌ "Light goes through the waveguide" (without loss/mode analysis)
- ❌ "Obviously this is better than electronics" (without fair comparison)

- [ ] Device geometry with dimensions
- [ ] Material system and layer stack

## Writing Notes

### Photonics Post Guidelines

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Specify wavelength always | Assume reader knows wavelength |
| Include loss budget | Report only device loss |
| Show sim vs. measured | Only show simulation |
| Explain fabrication constraints | Ignore process limitations |
| Quantify tolerances | Assume perfect fabrication |
| Include mode profiles | Skip field distributions |

### Units and Conventions

- Loss in dB (not linear)
- Wavelength in nm (or μm for mid-IR)
- Dimensions in nm/μm as appropriate
- Bandwidth: nm for wavelength, GHz for frequency

### Figures

- Always include scale bars
- Label wavelengths on spectra
- Show simulation and measurement on same plot when comparing
- Mode profiles need axis labels and colorbar
