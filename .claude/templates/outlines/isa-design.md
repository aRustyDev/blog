## Meta Requirements

### ISA Design Alignment Checklist

ISA design bridges software abstraction and hardware implementation. Your writing should:

- [ ] **Programmer model clarity** — How does software see and use these instructions?
- [ ] **Microarchitecture awareness** — Implementation implications of ISA choices
- [ ] **Encoding efficiency** — Opcode space, instruction length, field allocation
- [ ] **Composability** — How new instructions interact with existing ISA
- [ ] **Forward compatibility** — Extension points, reserved bits, versioning
- [ ] **Benchmark grounding** — Workloads that motivate these instructions

**ISA Design Voice Examples:**
- ✅ "This instruction reduces a 12-instruction sequence to 3, targeting the inner loop of..."
- ✅ "We allocate 3 bits for the mode field, reserving 2 encodings for future extension..."
- ✅ "The fused operation trades decode complexity for 40% energy reduction in..."
- ❌ "This instruction is faster" (without microarchitectural reasoning)
- ❌ "Obviously matrix multiply needs a dedicated instruction" (without tradeoff analysis)
- ❌ "The encoding is..." (without explaining constraints and alternatives)

## Writing Notes

### ISA Design Guidelines

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Show instruction encoding clearly | Describe encoding vaguely |
| Explain design tradeoffs | Present as obvious choices |
| Include code before/after | Only show new instructions |
| Consider implementation cost | Ignore hardware complexity |
| Plan for future extension | Consume all opcode space |
| Test with real workloads | Use microbenchmarks only |

### Encoding Diagrams

- Use ASCII art for portability
- Label every field
- Show bit positions explicitly
- Include reserved/must-be-zero fields

### Balancing Audiences

- Compiler writers need semantics
- Hardware designers need implementation hints
- System programmers need exceptions/privileges
- Serve all without overwhelming any
