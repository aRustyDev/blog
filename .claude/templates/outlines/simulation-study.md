## Meta Requirements

### Simulation Study Alignment Checklist

Simulation studies derive insights through computational experiments. Your writing should:

- [ ] **Methodology transparency** — Simulator, parameters, assumptions fully specified
- [ ] **Validity discussion** — How well does simulation represent reality?
- [ ] **Statistical rigor** — Multiple runs, confidence intervals, significance testing
- [ ] **Parameter sensitivity** — How robust are conclusions to parameter choices?
- [ ] **Reproducibility** — Sufficient detail for replication
- [ ] **Scope clarity** — What questions can/cannot be answered by this simulation

**Simulation Study Voice Examples:**
- ✅ "We simulated 1000 configurations, varying [parameters] across [ranges]..."
- ✅ "Results are robust to ±20% variation in [parameter], but sensitive to [other parameter]..."
- ✅ "The simulation assumes [X], which may not hold in [conditions]..."
- ❌ "The simulation proves [X]" (simulations don't prove, they suggest)
- ❌ "We ran the experiment" (clarify it's simulation, not physical)
- ❌ "Results show [X]" (without statistical context)

## Writing Notes

### Simulation Study Guidelines

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Specify all parameters | Omit "obvious" defaults |
| Report confidence intervals | Report only point estimates |
| Discuss validity explicitly | Assume reader trusts simulation |
| Show sensitivity analysis | Present single-point results |
| Make data/code available | Keep reproduction details private |
| Distinguish simulation from reality | Say "proves" or "demonstrates" |

### Statistical Rigor

- Always report variance/confidence intervals
- Multiple runs are mandatory, not optional
- State significance thresholds before seeing results
- Be wary of multiple comparison effects
- Effect size matters, not just significance

### Reproducibility Checklist

- [ ] Simulator version pinned
- [ ] All parameters listed
- [ ] Random seeds documented
- [ ] Code available
- [ ] Data available
- [ ] Instructions tested
